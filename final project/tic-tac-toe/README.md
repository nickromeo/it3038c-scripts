Hello and Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game. This is the same game but with a little twist. The Genius Computer is hard to beat. Can you defeat him????

To play the game, download or copy all python files and run the game file to play. The game will display in the console.
The super game file is just to show how powerful the Genius Computer is. After you run the super-game.py file, it will take a minute or so for the result to pop up but it should display in the console. This project is also useful because it can be a fun way to kill time and is cool to see how a script can caculate the best move to make only from a few lines of code.

I followed a video from Kylie Ying (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=3599s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
